 **To Students:**

 You can either fork the repository, download sourcecode zip file, or get it with git.

**To working with git:**

At first time:

change current directory to an arbitrary one, e.g (change directory to your home):

* `cd ~`
 
and then run this command to get sources:

* `git clone https://github.com/amirsojoodi/GPUProgrammingT.A.Class.git`

those who have forked the repository:

* `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPUProgrammingT.A.Class.git`

Then create a new branch, (current branch is the default branch, *master*) run: 

* `git branch *your-name*` 

Then move to the new created branch (you have not to edit sources when you are in master branch)

* `git checkout *your-name*`

Now feel free to edit codes and perform commits. (those who forked the project can push to their repository freely)

And after each update of the repository go to directory `GPUProgrammingT.A.Class` and run:

* `git pull`
 
**Important** 

if you have changed any parts of your code, you have to merge repositories in order to make sure everything is updated. For this purpose you have to create pull request in this reposistory.
