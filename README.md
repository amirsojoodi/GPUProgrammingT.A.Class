#### GPUProgramming T.A.Class codes and stuff.

**To Students:**
You can either fork the repository, download sourcecode zip file, or get it with git.

**To working with git**
At first time:
change current directory to an arbitrary one, e.g:
* `cd Desktop`
and then run this command to get sources:
* `git clone https://github.com/amirsojoodi/GPUProgrammingT.A.Class.git`
those who have forked the repository:
* `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPUProgrammingT.A.Class.git`

Then create a new branch, (current branch is the default branch, *master*) run: 
* `git branch *your-name*` 
Then move to the new created branch (you have not to edit sources when you are in master branch)
* `git checkout *your-name*`

Now feel free to edit codes and commits. (those who forked the project can push to their repository)

And after each update of the repository go to directory `GPUProgrammingT.A.Class` and run:
* `git pull`
**Important** if you have changed any parts of your code into something else, you have to merge repositories. For this purpose you have to create pull request in this reposistory.
